\title{
Compute a correlation between the every gene crispr KO vs each drug response
}
\description{

to compute the correlations between the viability of cell lines after CRISPR knockout of each gene and the viability of the same cell lines after drug treatment
}
\usage{
GetSim(drugName =DrugName, DRS= drugResponseScore,GES= GeneEffectScores)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{drugName}{
     Drug Name
}
  \item{DRS}{
      Drugâ€™s response scores
}
  \item{GES}{
      Gene effect scores from Knock-out method such as CRISPR.
}
}
